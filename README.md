📚 Concepts to Learn Today

Binary Search Basics (Classic)

Works on sorted arrays/lists

Time complexity: O(log n)

Basic idea:

Find mid

Compare with target

Move left or right

Python pattern:

python
Copy
Edit
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
Binary Search Variants

Lower bound (first occurrence)

Upper bound (last occurrence)

Binary search on answer (search space reduction on values, not index)

Binary Search on 2D Arrays & Bitonic Arrays

When to apply Binary Search on Answer?

Search space is monotonic (yes/no)

These techniques are critical for solving array and string problems efficiently and are frequently asked in interviews. They help optimize brute-force solutions to O(n) time.

—

📚 Concepts to Learn Today

Two Pointer Technique

Commonly used when dealing with sorted arrays or strings.

Use two indices to scan from both ends or same end.

Can be used for:

Pair sums

Removing duplicates

Partitioning arrays

Merging arrays/lists

Example:
Finding a pair with sum = target in a sorted array:

python
Copy
Edit
def two_sum_sorted(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        curr_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
        if curr_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif curr_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

Useful for problems involving subarrays, substrings.

Use a window (start to end pointer) and slide it forward.

Used for:

Maximum/minimum sum of subarray of size k

Longest substring with certain condition

Count of subarrays with sum/condition

Pattern:

Fixed window: when window size is known

Variable window: when condition is known

Goal: Find the minimum cost/distance to reach one or all nodes in a graph.

Used in: navigation systems, networking, scheduling, etc.

Applicable on weighted graphs (positive or negative weights)

Dijkstra’s Algorithm

For graphs with non-negative weights

Uses a priority queue (min-heap)

Greedy: always processes the nearest unvisited node first

Python implementation uses:

python
Copy
Edit
import heapq

heap = [(0, start_node)]
dist = {start_node: 0}

while heap:
    cost, u = heapq.heappop(heap)
    for v, weight in graph[u]:

📚 Concepts to Learn Today

What is Greedy Algorithm?

A greedy algorithm builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.

It doesn’t always give the global optimum but often works in interval scheduling, Huffman coding, coin change (in some cases), etc.

Greedy Algorithm Patterns

Interval Scheduling & Merging

Activity Selection

Min/Max Heap for selection

Two pointers / sorting + greedy

Always sort by some property first (e.g., start time, end time, cost)

Compare Greedy vs DP

Greedy doesn’t explore all possibilities — DP does

Greedy = fast but not always optimal; DP = optimal but slower

📅 Day 30 (June 30) – High-Level Design (HLD): System Design Concepts

🎯 Goal: Understand how to design scalable, fault-tolerant systems that can handle millions of users using distributed system components and architectural patterns.

📘 Concepts to Learn

Load Balancer

Distributes traffic across multiple servers.

Types: Layer 4 (TCP), Layer 7 (HTTP).

Helps with horizontal scaling and fault tolerance.

Caching Strategies

Types: Client-side, CDN, Server-side (e.g., Redis).

Techniques: Write-through, Write-back, Write-around.

Use Cases: Reduce DB load, faster reads.

Database Sharding & Replication

Sharding: Splitting data across nodes.

Replication: Copying data across nodes (master-slave, master-master).

Message Queues

Tools: Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS.

Used for decoupling services, event-driven architectures.

CAP Theorem

Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance – pick 2 out of 3.

Examples: CP (MongoDB), AP (Cassandra), CA (no distributed system).

Consistency Models

Strong vs Eventual Consistency

Quorum-based reads/writes

Leader Election Algorithms

Raft, Paxos: Coordination in distributed systems (e.g., database clusters)

Rate Limiting

Algorithms: Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket.

Prevents abuse and overload.

Data Partitioning

Hash-based: Even distribution

Range-based: Good for range queries

Long Polling, WebSockets

Real-time communication

Long polling: HTTP trick for real-time

WebSockets: Full-duplex communication

Circuit Breaker & Retry Logic

Improves system resilience by stopping repeated failures

Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

Horizontal = more machines

Vertical = more powerful machine

CDN & Geo-Distributed Systems

CDN: Fast delivery of static content

Geo-distribution: Reduced latency

Microservices vs Monolith

Microservices: Independent deployment, scalability

Monolith: Simpler dev, but less scalable

API Gateway & BFF Pattern

Gateway: Entry point for services

BFF: Backend tailored for specific frontend

Authentication & Authorization

AuthN: Who are you? (Login)

AuthZ: What can you access?

in above june 1 to june 30 is any concept and problem is repeatiting

Great question. Based on the roadmap provided from June 1 to June 30, here's an audit of the topics and problem sets to identify any significant repetition:

🧠 Conceptual Audit (June 1 – June 30)

I’ve divided the audit into:

Unique Concepts Introduced

Repetition Check (Concepts appearing more than once)

Justified Repeats (when repetition is intentional or complementary)

Unnecessary Repeats (if any)

✅ Unique Concepts Covered (Grouped)

Python Fundamentals (Day 1)

Variables, conditionals, loops, functions, lists, dicts

Data Structures & Basic DSA (Days 2–10)

Arrays, Strings, HashMaps, Sliding Window, Two Pointers

Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists

Binary Search, Binary Search on Answer

Recursion & Backtracking

Sorting (Bubble, Insertion, Selection)

Prefix Sum, Difference Array

Trees & Graphs (Days 11–15, Day 28)

Binary Trees, BST

Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

DFS/BFS

Binary Tree Problems

Graph Representations, Traversals

Advanced Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Topo Sort, Kruskal, Prim, DSU)

Advanced Algorithms (Days 16–20)

Dynamic Programming: Fibonacci, Knapsack, LCS, LIS, Kadane

Trie, Bit Manipulation

Huffman Coding, Rabin-Karp

Advanced DSA & Patterns (Days 21–27)

Greedy

Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quickselect

Searching Algorithms (Binary Search variants, A*, Flood Fill, Lee)

System Design & LLD/HLD (Days 29–30)

OOP, SOLID, Design Patterns

UML, Class & Sequence Diagrams

High-Level Architecture (Load Balancers, Caching, Sharding, CAP Theorem, Rate Limiting, Microservices, etc.)

🔁 Repetition Check

Here are some overlaps identified:

Binary Search

Day 3: Introduced and practiced

Day 28: Revisited under searching algorithms

DFS/BFS

Day 13–15 (Graph traversal problems)

Day 28 (Re-explored in grid context and algorithms like Flood Fill)

Kth Largest / Heap Usage

Day 16: Heap introduction

Day 27: Revisited in context of sorting and selection (Quickselect)

Trees

Day 11–12: Binary Tree + Traversals

Day 28: DFS/BFS grid applications (related traversal, but not tree-specific)

Greedy

Day 18: Introduced with problems like Activity Selection

May also reappear within sorting or DP for specific problems (but not repeated as a full topic)

🔁 Justified Repeats

Binary Search and DFS/BFS were repeated in different contexts (arrays vs grid, trees vs graphs). This is good pedagogy to strengthen understanding in varied applications.

Heap & Priority Queue problems were spaced and applied in multiple problem domains (sorting, graphs, top-K) — this is intentional.

Revisiting topics like DFS in grid (Flood Fill, Lee Algo) after learning graph traversal is natural and strategic.

❌ Unnecessary Repeats

None. No topics were repeated identically or redundantly. All follow-up appearances were contextually deeper or applied in new domains.

📝 Conclusion

There is no unintentional or wasteful repetition in your June 1–30 roadmap. Concepts are structured to appear first in isolation and then applied across multiple domains or problem types (which is how real-world interview prep works best). The progression is deliberate and pedagogically sound.

Would you like a summary list of all 30 days’ main concepts for easy review, or should I proceed with the July 1–7 revision and master problem set planning?
